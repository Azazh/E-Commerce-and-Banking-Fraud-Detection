# Fraud Detection for E-Commerce and Bank Transactions

This project focuses on improving fraud detection for e-commerce and bank transactions using advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques. The goal is to build robust models that can accurately identify fraudulent activities by leveraging transaction data, geolocation analysis, and pattern recognition.

## Task 1 - Data Analysis and Preprocessing

This task involves cleaning, analyzing, and preprocessing the transaction data to prepare it for machine learning models. The steps include:

1. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - Impute or drop missing values in the datasets.
   - Script: `scripts/handle_missing_values.py`.

2. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Remove duplicates and correct data types.
   - Script: `scripts/data_cleaning.py`.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Perform univariate and bivariate analysis to understand the data.
   - Notebook: `notebooks/eda.ipynb`.

4. **Merge Datasets for Geolocation Analysis**:
   - Convert IP addresses to integer format and merge `Fraud_Data.csv` with `IpAddress_to_Country.csv`.
   - Script: `scripts/merge_geolocation.py`.

5. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Create new features like transaction frequency, time-based features, and normalized/encoded features.
   - Script: `scripts/feature_engineering.py`.

6. **Unit Tests**:
   - Test the functionality of each script in the `tests/` folder.

## Datasets

The following datasets are used in this project:

1. **Fraud_Data.csv**:
   - Contains e-commerce transaction data with features like `user_id`, `purchase_time`, `purchase_value`, `device_id`, `source`, `browser`, `sex`, `age`, `ip_address`, and `class` (target variable).

2. **IpAddress_to_Country.csv**:
   - Maps IP address ranges to countries.

3. **creditcard.csv**:
   - Contains anonymized bank transaction data with features like `Time`, `V1-V28` (PCA components), `Amount`, and `Class` (target variable).

## How to Run the Code

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com//fraud-detection.git
   cd fraud-detection
   ```

2. **Set Up the Environment**:
   - Install the required Python packages:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Run the Scripts**:
   - Execute the scripts in the following order:
     ```bash
     python scripts/handle_missing_values.py
     python scripts/data_cleaning.py
     python scripts/merge_geolocation.py
     python scripts/feature_engineering.py
     ```

4. **Run the EDA Notebook**:
   - Open and run the Jupyter notebook `notebooks/eda.ipynb` to perform exploratory data analysis.

5. **Run Unit Tests**:
   - Execute the unit tests to ensure the scripts are working correctly:
     ```bash
     python -m pytest tests/
     ```

## Results

After completing Task 1, the following outputs will be generated:
- Cleaned and preprocessed datasets in the `data/` folder.
- New features like `hour_of_day`, `day_of_week`, `transaction_frequency`, and `country`.
- Visualizations and insights from the EDA notebook.

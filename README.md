### **README: Fraud Detection System**

---

#### **Project Overview**
This repository contains the code and documentation for a fraud detection system developed for e-commerce and banking transactions at Adey Innovations Inc. The system leverages machine learning models to identify fraudulent activities accurately while ensuring transparency through explainability tools like SHAP and LIME.

The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and deployment preparation. It is designed to handle large volumes of transactions in real-time and adapt to evolving fraud patterns.

#### **Business Need**
Fraudulent transactions pose a significant risk to e-commerce and banking businesses, leading to financial losses and reduced customer trust. This project aims to develop an accurate and interpretable fraud detection system that:
- Identifies fraudulent transactions in real-time.
- Enhances transaction security.
- Provides insights into model predictions using SHAP and LIME for transparency and trust.

---

#### **Dataset Description**
The project uses the following datasets:
1. **Fraud_Data.csv**:
   - Contains e-commerce transaction data.
   - Features include `user_id`, `signup_time`, `purchase_time`, `purchase_value`, `device_id`, `source`, `browser`, `sex`, `age`, `ip_address`, and `class` (target variable).

2. **IpAddress_to_Country.csv**:
   - Maps IP addresses to countries.
   - Features include `lower_bound_ip_address`, `upper_bound_ip_address`, and `country`.

3. **creditcard.csv**:
   - Contains bank credit transaction data specifically curated for fraud detection.
   - Features include anonymized features (`V1` to `V28`), `Amount`, and `Class` (target variable).

#### **Setup Instructions**
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone hhttps://github.com/Azazh/E-Commerce-and-Banking-Fraud-Detection.git
   cd E-Commerce-and-Banking-Fraud-Detection
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed. Then, install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Start MLflow Server** (Optional):
   If you plan to use MLflow for experiment tracking:
   ```bash
   mlflow server --backend-store-uri ./mlruns --default-artifact-root ./artifacts --host 0.0.0.0 --port 5000
   ```

4. **Run the Scripts**:
   - Preprocess the data:
     ```bash
     python scripts/preprocess.py
     ```
   - Train the models:
     ```bash
     python scripts/model_training.py
     ```
   - Generate explanations:
     ```bash
     python scripts/model_explain.py
     ```

#### **Key Features**
- **Data Preprocessing**:
  - Handles missing values, duplicates, and incorrect data types.
  - Extracts time-based features and merges geolocation data for enriched insights.

- **Model Building**:
  - Implements multiple machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, MLP).
  - Uses stratified train-test splits for balanced evaluation.

- **Explainability**:
  - Provides global and local explanations using SHAP and LIME.
  - Generates summary plots, force plots, and dependence plots for interpretability.

- **Deployment Readiness**:
  - Saves trained models for deployment.
  - Includes mechanisms for continuous monitoring and retraining.

---

#### **Usage**
1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Run `preprocess.py` to clean and prepare the datasets.
   - Output files will be saved in the `data/` directory.

2. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Use `feature_engineering.py` to engineer new features such as `hour_of_day`, `day_of_week`, and `time_since_signup`.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Execute `model_training.py` to train and evaluate multiple models.
   - Results and metrics are logged using MLflow.

4. **Model Explainability**:
   - Run `model_explain.py` to generate SHAP and LIME explanations for the trained models.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the best-performing models using Docker or cloud-based solutions (e.g., AWS SageMaker, Azure ML).

#### **Results**
- **Performance Metrics**:
  | Dataset         | Model               | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | ROC-AUC |
  |-----------------|---------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
  | Fraud_Data      | Random Forest       | 0.97     | 0.92      | 0.90   | 0.91     | 0.96    |
  | Fraud_Data      | XGBoost             | 0.98     | 0.93      | 0.91   | 0.92     | 0.97    |
  | CreditCard Data | XGBoost             | 0.99     | 0.95      | 0.93   | 0.94     | 0.98    |

- **Explainability**:
  - SHAP summary plots highlight the most important features globally.
  - LIME explanations provide detailed insights into individual predictions.
